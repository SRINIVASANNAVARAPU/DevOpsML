#Day3 #Summary #SessionSummary
Quick recap of Git and GitHub.
Architecture of DevOps(Development and Operation)
Tasks of #Devloper #Operations
Process involved when a new application request from a client to be developed and deployed.
Setting up an environment for a Webserver.
Client request --> Development team --> SCM(GitHub) --> System(Hardware, OS, webserver) --> Application accessible to client

#Devloper
Development Team: Development team gets the requirement for the development of new application from the client, based on their requirement. 
Developers prepare a code based on the application requirement(Java,Python,etc..).
Application will be saved in Local repository called Git (De centralized control version system)
Creating Repository, file, initialize git, adding files to git, commit, upstream, push to GitHub
Developed code will be synced with SCM(GitHub) account.

#Operations
Operations team has to build server with the specific requirement that support the application to be deployed.
Based on the requirement of application it can be a (Physical server, Virtual machine, Cloud based server, Container)
This example, we are taking a Virtual machine. Now Operations team has to clone the code from GitHub to Webserver
Finally the application will be available to client

There are lot of manual operations that are being performed in this process. There are lot of Silos between #Dev#Ops
Operations team has to continuously look for the updated code from Github and clone to the Webserver, this require manual efforts.
If the code fails they have to reach to #Developer. If the #Operations aware of the previous code they will roll back the code. 
All this require manual effort, which will impact the client satisfaction.
To fulfil the Silos between the #Operations #Developer #DevOps
